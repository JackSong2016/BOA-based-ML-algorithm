Bayesian optimization is widely used optimize multi-parameters systems, which accelerates scientific discovery of materials and system design. Particularly, it can also be used to optimize the complicated hyperparameters in machine learning algorithms. Here is one example application HDH system of Bayesian Optimization to optimize the hyperparameters of machine learning algorithms, such as Random forest algorithm，Support vector machine and Multi layer perceptron.
